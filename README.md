# bhack - the "b-side" hack of the BACH library for Pd

### Version 0.0.0-aplha-0



--------------------------------------------------------------------------

About: 

This is a family of objects inspired by the BACH library for MAX, which deal with "llll" (lisp-like linked lists). 

It relies on "pdlua" to manage this new data type. 

This is supposed to be incorporated into the ELSE library, which supports externals written in lua.
